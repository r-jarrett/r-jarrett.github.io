Good decisions come from knowledge.  Knowledge grows by sharing observations and  experiences. Sustaining a shared resource calls  for constructive sharing of information. It is  within this context that fishermen, scientists,  policymakers, managers, association  representatives and other leaders in the lobster  industry from the east coast of the United  States and Canada converge once a year for  the Lobster Institute’s Canada/U.S. Lobster  Town Meeting to talk about the state of  Homarus americanus and the industry that  relies upon this resource – its markets,  policies, and economics.  The theme of the 16th Lobster Town Meeting,  hosted in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada  January 24 – 25, 2020; was “forging our  futures together.” The focus of the meeting  was to: (1) facilitate cross-sector and crossgeographic networking; and (2) discuss  emerging and persistent issues in the fishery.  In particular, this year’s meeting focused on  lobster processing, marketing techniques,  North Atlantic right whales, and media  relations.  The one-and-a-half-day meeting drew more  than 100 participants from across maritime  Canada and the Northeast United States. This  report provides a summary of the sessions  hosted at the event and the key themes that  emerged during the Town Meeting.
