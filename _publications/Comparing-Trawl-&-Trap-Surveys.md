<b>Abstract:</b>
A comparison of size distributions between trawl and trap surveys revealed a pronounced decline in the frequency of lobsters above the minimum legal size in trap surveys, while trawl surveys exhibited a much weaker decline. These findings suggest that individual behavioral traits may lead certain lobsters to avoid traps, with implications for both fisheries management and sustainable harvest practices.
