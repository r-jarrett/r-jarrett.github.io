Marine Ecology is an undergraduate field course during Semester by the Sea hosted at the University of Maine's Darling Marine Center. I assisted the course's professor, Dr. Bob Steneck. I led students into field for sampling in the intertidal zone and aboard research vessel. I maintained an herbivory experiment over several weeks to collect data for students to analyze. I assisted and mentored students in processing field samples, analyzing data, and weekly writing reports.
