I was the Head Sailing Instructor for the summer junior sailing program at Monmouth Boat Club on the Navesink River. I developed a new curriculum for the Optimist and 420 sailing courses prior to the start of the summer. I led the maintenance and upkeep of the club's fleet of dinghy sailboats. I oversaw a team of six sailing instructors across beginner, intermediate, and advanced classes. I assisted with beginner sailing course daily and coached intermediate sailors at regattas.
