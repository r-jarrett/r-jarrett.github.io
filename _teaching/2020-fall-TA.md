Undergraduate Field Course at University of Maine's Darling Marine Center

Due to the pandemic this course shifted to an online modality, while best maintaining the instruction of field sampling techniques. I assisted the course's professor, Dr. Bob Steneck. I recorded videos in the field demonstrating sampling techniques or data collection. I maintained classroom materials using Brightspace and assisted students over zoom when necessary.
