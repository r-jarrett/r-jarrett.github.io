Hi! I'm a fifth year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Maine based out of the Darling Marine Center in the Midcoast of Maine. I am advised by Bob Steneck and Damian Brady. My research interests focuses on ecological interactions, specifically in benthic marine habitats.

My dissertation research focuses on changes in American lobster ecology over the past 25 years. I have conducted an array of field sampling using a variety of methods including scuba, remotely operated vehicles, and submersibles to find patterns and changes in lobster demography. I am also using a vareity of techniques to parse out which processes and mechanism drive these changes including laboratory experiments, seafloor mapping, generalized additive models, individual based models.

While at the University of Maine, I also earned my M.S. in Marine Policy. During that program, I completed an internship with the Maine Department of Marine Resources. During the internship I worked to develop a survey for gillnet fishers in Maine and New England about the gear configurations that they use to fish. The information could then be used by managers to understand the impacts of additional regulations on fishers meant to protect the North Atlantic Right Whale. 

Another highlight of my graduate career has been conducting research on Bonaire's coral reefs. I conducted a week of fish surveys, working alongside STINAPA (Bonaire's national park agency) on the 20th year of monitoring. I also assisted in the production of the report submitted to STINAPA, that in the past, has supported and documented the sucess of conservation efforts that have resulted in the only documented resilient reef system in the Caribbean.  



Prior to moving to Maine, I spent a year working following earning my B.S. at Rutgers University. During the time, I was the Head Sailing Instructor at Monmouth Boat Club for the summer and worked at the Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory under Daphne Monroe on a variety of projects. While at Rutgers, in addition to working on my degree, I worked in the Asphalt Pavement Laboratory of several environmental projects and spent a lot of time sailing and racing with the Rutgers Sailing Team.
