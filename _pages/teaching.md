# Teaching Experience

<br>

**Micro-Credential Developer & Instructor** - 2025-2026 - Darling Marine Center, University of Maine

I designed a hybrid Micro-Credential integrating self paced online modules with hands on field training in ROV operation and underwater survey methods. I focused on creating accessible instructional materials including video demonstrations, step by step technical guides, and scaffolded practice activities and developing competency based assessments to evaluate learner proficiency in ROV maintenance, piloting, survey design, and data interpretation.

**Marine Ecology Teaching Assistant** - Fall 2021 - School of Marine Sciences, University of Maine

I was a TA for Marine Ecology which is an undergraduate field course during Semester by the Sea at the Darling Marine Center. I assisted the course’s professor, Dr. Bob Steneck. I led students into field for sampling in the intertidal zone and aboard research vessel. I maintained an herbivory experiment over several weeks to collect data for students to analyze. I assisted and mentored students in processing field samples, analyzing data, and weekly writing reports.

**Marine Ecology Teaching Assistant** - Fall 2020 - School of Marine Sciences, University of Maine

I was a TA for Marine Ecology which is an undergraduate field course during Semester by the Sea at the Darling Marine Center. Due to the pandemic this course shifted to an online modality, while best maintaining the instruction of field sampling techniques. I assisted the course’s professor, Dr. Bob Steneck. I recorded videos in the field demonstrating sampling techniques or data collection. I maintained classroom materials using Brightspace and assisted students over zoom when necessary.

**Scientific Graphics and Data Visualization Workshop Leader** - Jan 2023 - Graduate Student Professional Development Retreat, School of Marine Science

I designed and led an applied workshop on scientific graphics for research communication, with a focus on graphical abstracts, figure design, and integrating graphics and data. the workshop centered on principles of visual hierarchy, narrative flow, and multimodal communication, helping participants translate complex ecological and environmental datasets into clear, compelling visuals. I helped guide students through evaluating and redesigning figures for accessibility, including strategies for color vision–safe palettes, contrast optimization, and alternatives that reduce reliance on color

**Head Sailing Instructior** - Summer 2018 - Monmouth Boat Club

I was the Head Sailing Instructor for the summer junior sailing program at Monmouth Boat Club on the Navesink River. I developed a new curriculum for the Optimist and 420 sailing courses prior to the start of the summer. I led the maintenance and upkeep of the club’s fleet of dinghy sailboats. I oversaw a team of six sailing instructors across beginner, intermediate, and advanced classes. I assisted with beginner sailing course daily and coached intermediate sailors at regattas.

# Mentoring

**Summer Intern Supervisor** - 2019-2022 - Darling Marine Center

I mentored undergraduate researchers working various components of lobster ecology studies including scuba and ROV surveys, flowing seawater lab experiments. I guided students through experimental design, ecological sampling, data management, and quantitative analysis in R and supported them in preparing posters and presentations for academic/public audiences. I focused on fostering an inclusive, supportive research environment that welcomed students with diverse levels of prior experience.

**Bonaire Coral Reef Survey Field Researcher** - March 2023 - University of Maine, Steneck Lab

I helped prepare undergraduate students in Coral Reefs course for a week long field trip by reviewing survey protocols, practicing underwater data collection techniques, and supporting their readiness for ecological scuba surveys. In the field, I guided students through post dive logistics, including transcribing data, organizing field notes, and managing datasets to ensure accuracy and consistency across survey sites. After the trip, I mentored students in ecological data analysis and scientific writing, assisting them in interpreting ecological patterns and developing clear, well structured final reports.
