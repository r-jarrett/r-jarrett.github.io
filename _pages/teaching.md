# Teaching Experience

**Marine Ecology Teaching Assistant** - Fall 2021 - School of Marine Sciences, University of Maine

I was a TA for Marine Ecology which is an undergraduate field course during Semester by the Sea at the Darling Marine Center. I assisted the course’s professor, Dr. Bob Steneck. I led students into field for sampling in the intertidal zone and aboard research vessel. I maintained an herbivory experiment over several weeks to collect data for students to analyze. I assisted and mentored students in processing field samples, analyzing data, and weekly writing reports.

**Marine Ecology Teaching Assistant** - Fall 2020 - School of Marine Sciences, University of Maine

I was a TA for Marine Ecology which is an undergraduate field course during Semester by the Sea at the Darling Marine Center. Due to the pandemic this course shifted to an online modality, while best maintaining the instruction of field sampling techniques. I assisted the course’s professor, Dr. Bob Steneck. I recorded videos in the field demonstrating sampling techniques or data collection. I maintained classroom materials using Brightspace and assisted students over zoom when necessary.

**Head Sailing Instructior** - Summer 2018 - Monmouth Boat Club

I was the Head Sailing Instructor for the summer junior sailing program at Monmouth Boat Club on the Navesink River. I developed a new curriculum for the Optimist and 420 sailing courses prior to the start of the summer. I led the maintenance and upkeep of the club’s fleet of dinghy sailboats. I oversaw a team of six sailing instructors across beginner, intermediate, and advanced classes. I assisted with beginner sailing course daily and coached intermediate sailors at regattas.
